<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h3>

<p>A single-purpose Bitcoin Sidechain for resolving The Blocksize Debate of 2015.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h3>

<p>This concept employs "conditional prediction markets", <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/07/intrades-condit.html">as advocated by Hal Finney</a>, a remarkable individual who <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hal_Finney">received the first ever Bitcoin transaction</a>. Hal was <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erhanson/PromisePredMkt.pdf">joined by</a>  multiple Nobel-prize winners, thought leaders, and executives in the field of information technology.</p>

<h4>
<a id="the-states" class="anchor" href="#the-states" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The States</h4>

<p>A multi-state prediction market allows us to examine the future price of Bitcoin, under a number of mutually-exclusive states (in this case, Blocksize Limit Proposals). We also get the (unanimously-acknowledged) liklihood of each state.</p>

<p>Preliminary list of states:</p>

<ol>
<li>"NA" - No action is taken wrt the Bitcoin Blocksize. It remains at 1 MB.</li>
<li>"Soft" - Any protocol change(s) not requiring a hard fork. For example, Back's "extension blocks".</li>
<li>"Static 2MB" - (BIP 102) a hard fork increases the limit to 2 MB or fewer, for "breathing room".</li>
<li>"Static 8MB" - Scheduled increase reaching 2 to 8 MB in 4 or fewer years (incl. 2-4-8 Back-Andresen Compromise).</li>
<li>"Garzik" - (BIP 100) Hard Fork to 1 MB, yet allow miners to vote on a floating Blocksize.</li>
<li>"Andresen" - (BIP 101) Hard Fork to 8 MB, limit doubles every 2 years for a period of 20 years.</li>
<li>"Hearn" - (BitcoinXT) Hard Fork to 20 MB.</li>
</ol>

<p>If two or more Blocksize Solutions were tried, the highest numbered (bottom-most position) wins. Uniqueness is guaranteed by Bitcoin's highest-cumulative-work rule.</p>

<h4>
<a id="operation" class="anchor" href="#operation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Operation</h4>

<p>The prediction market accepts and pays out BTC according to the federated peg model (the only model currently available). Trading is accomplished with <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/LogMSR_Demo.xlsx">a single-formula Market Scoring Rule</a>.</p>

<h4>
<a id="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resolution</h4>

<p>On August 1st, 2016, a panel of pre-selected individuals, chosen for their (objectively-measurable) current stake in the Bitcoin Ecosystem (and NOT for any subjective evaluation of "expertise"), collaborates to report on two things: [1] which of the 7 Solutions were indeed selected, and [2] the 1-week average closing USD/BTC price as reported by Google. These individuals may be the same as those managing sidechain-withdrawals.</p>

<p>After users withdraw their money, the sidechain is closed down permanently.</p>

<h3>
<a id="benefits" class="anchor" href="#benefits" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Benefits</h3>

<ol>
<li>Information: Users can keep up with the status of the debate, without relying on distorted or censored information-channels. Business have access to reliable, objective information on the likelihood of different proposals, which they can use for projection and project planning.</li>
<li>Hedging: Users can protect the value of their Bitcoin with "Selective Selling". Users can also purchase insurance, such that they receive Bitcoin if a non-desired outcome occurs.</li>
<li>Discourse: With clear evaluation criteria, and objective measurement of those criteria, the debate can proceed based on universally-observable scientific fact. Personal attacks and intimidation tactics would serve no purpose and would not be attempted.</li>
</ol>

<h4>
<a id="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h4>

<p>A rejection of Bitcoin's established Social Contract ("the code") is very risky. Even the mere possibility of a bad outcome leaves users in an uncomfortable position. Their only current option is to sell their Bitcoin for Fiat, and hope to repurchase these BTC post-decision. This has the obvious drawback of denying users their BTC, and subjecting them to repurchase price-volatility.</p>

<h4>
<a id="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Solution</h4>

<p>This project allows users to make <a href="http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/win-win-blocksize/">clever purchases of crypto-assets</a>, which conditionally refund their Bitcoin at a "locked in" exchange rate, if and only if an undesired Blocksize Outcome occurs. Otherwise, these individuals achieve the Bitcoin return they would have originally received.</p>

<h4>
<a id="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra Benefits</h4>

<p>Therefore, every Bitcoin user who is NOT indifferent to the current Blocksize Outlook can use this market to become so.</p>

<a id="faq-tba" class="anchor" href="#faq-tba" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAQ</h3>

<h4>
<a id="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So, if two people disagree, we're going to let whoever has more Bitcoin win?</h4>

<p>No. That would be plutocracy ("one dollar, one vote"), this is capitalism ("one dollar risked, one vote"). Rich people can spend their money on all kinds of things (that aren't this). And this project only produces advice, it can't force anyone to do anything.</p>

<h4>
<a id="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What if I have something to contribute but don't feel comfortable betting?</h4>

<p>Sorry, but you're not wanted here. Markets emphasize openness (anyone can trade) and filtration (each trade requires you to stake money).</p>

<p>Why has this process become the most sucessful forecasting and allocation tool in the history of the planet? Not because it seeks out experts (experts are overrated, and new concepts may require new experts), but because it filters the non-experts.</p>

<p>If you insist on being heard, feel free to partner with a rich friend, who can invest on your behalf.</p>

<h4>
<a id="resolution" class="anchor" href="#resolution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Markets can be manipulated!</h4>

<p>And subreddits, forums, mailing lists, and backroom deals with major buisiness can't be manipulated? The question is which communication medium is least-manipulable, and immense theoretical and empirical work has shown that markets are, in fact, nearly immune to manipulation. This is primarily because, while some people may prefer some outcome, everyone prefers to have more money.</p>
