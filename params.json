{"name":"The Blocksize Markets","tagline":"Blocksize Data: Simple, Relevant, and Objective","body":"### What is this?\r\nA single-purpose Bitcoin Sidechain for resolving The Blocksize Debate of 2015.\r\n\r\n### How It Works\r\nThis concept employs \"conditional prediction markets\", [as advocated by Hal Finney](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/07/intrades-condit.html), a remarkable individual who [received the first ever Bitcoin transaction](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Hal_Finney). Hal was joined by [multiple Nobel-prize winners, thought leaders, and executives in the field of information technology](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/PromisePredMkt.pdf).\r\n\r\n#### The States\r\n\r\nA multi-state prediction market allows observers to understand what the price of Bitcoin would be under each individual state. In this case, we simply select these states to be Blocksize Limit Proposals.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary (negotiable) list of mutually-exclusive states is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. \"NA\" - No action is taken wrt the Bitcoin Blocksize. It remains at 1 MB.\r\n2. \"Soft\" - A protocol change not requiring a hard fork. For example, Back's \"extension blocks\".\r\n3. \"Static 2MB\" - (BIP 102) a hard fork increases the limit to 2 MB or fewer, for \"breathing room\".\r\n4. \"Static 8MB\" - Scheduled increase reaching 2 to 8 MB in 4 or fewer years (incl. 2-4-8 Back-Andresen Compromise).\r\n5. \"Garzik\" - (BIP 100) Hard Fork to 1 MB, yet allow miners to vote on a floating Blocksize.\r\n6. \"Andresen\" - (BIP 101) Hard Fork to 8 MB, limit doubles every 2 years for a period of 20 years.\r\n7. \"Hearn\" - (BitcoinXT) Hard Fork to 20 MB.\r\n\r\n#### Operation\r\n\r\nThe prediction market accepts and pays out BTC according to the federated peg model (the only model currently available). Trading is accomplished with [a single-formula Market Scoring Rule](http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/LogMSR_Demo.xlsx).\r\n\r\n#### Resolution\r\n\r\nOn August 1st, 2016, a panel of pre-selected individuals, chosen for their (objectively-measurable) current stake in the Bitcoin Ecosystem (and NOT for any subjective evaluation of \"expertise\"), collaborates to report on two things: [1] which of the 7 were selected, and [2] 1-week average closing USD/BTC price as reported by Google. If two or more Blocksize Solutions were tried, the one with the higher number wins.\r\n\r\nAfter users withdraw their money, the sidechain is closed down permanently.\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n1. Information: Users can keep up with the status of the debate, without relying on distorted or censored information-channels. Business have access to reliable, objective information on the likelihood of different proposals, which they can use for projection and project planning.\r\n2. Hedging: Users can protect the value of their Bitcoin with \"Selective Selling\". Users can also purchase insurance, such that they receive Bitcoin if a non-desired outcome occurs.\r\n3. Discourse: With clear evaluation criteria, and objective measurement of those criteria, the debate can proceed based on universally-observable scientific fact. Personal attacks and intimidation tactics would serve no purpose and would not be attempted.\r\n\r\n### Protect Your Money\r\n\r\nA rejection of Bitcoin's established Social Contract (\"the code\") is very risky. Even the mere possibility of a bad outcome leaves users in an uncomfortable position. Their only current option is to sell their Bitcoin for Fiat, and hope to repurchase these BTC post-decision. This has the obvious drawback of denying users their BTC, and subjecting them to repurchase price-volatility.\r\n\r\nThis project allows users to make [clever purchases of crypto-assets](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/win-win-blocksize/), which conditionally refund their Bitcoin at a \"locked in\" exchange rate, if and only if an undesired Blocksize Outcome occurs. Otherwise, these individuals achieve the Bitcoin return they would have originally received.\r\n\r\nTherefore, every Bitcoin user who is NOT indifferent to the current Blocksize Outlook can use this market to become so.\r\n\r\n### FAQ (tba)","google":"UA-56338583-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
